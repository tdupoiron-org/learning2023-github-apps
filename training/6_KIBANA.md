# Kibana

The goal of this small project is to capture issues into an external dashboard that could be customized by stakeholders to take decisions.

I created a trial account on Elastic Cloud.

* Open the https://learning-pills-mar-2023.kb.eu-west-3.aws.elastic-cloud.com:9243 in a new tab

* Choose "Log in with Elasticsearch"

* Sign in using those credentials: 
  * Username = axa
  * Password = learning2023

Open the ["GitHub Issues" dashboard](https://learning-pills-mar-2023.kb.eu-west-3.aws.elastic-cloud.com:9243/app/dashboards#/view/ce1179f0-bd18-11ed-bee3-278b0da2c55e?_g=(filters:!(),refreshInterval:(pause:!f,value:5000),time:(from:now-1h,to:now)))

There you are !
You should see your issue created earlier.

Go ahead by creating new issues, changing the assignees or the tags, adding comments and closing it.

Run the Javascript script again to see modifications in Kibana.
