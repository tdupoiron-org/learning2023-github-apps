# Kibana

The goal of this small project is to capture issues into an external dashboard that could be customized by stakeholders to take decisions.

I created a trial account on Elastic Cloud.

* Open the https://learning-pills-mar-2023.kb.eu-west-3.aws.elastic-cloud.com:9243 in a new tab

* Choose "Log in with Elasticsearch"

* Sign in using those credentials: 
  * Username = axa
  * Password = learning2023

Open the ["GitHub Issues" dashboard](https://learning-pills-mar-2023.kb.eu-west-3.aws.elastic-cloud.com:9243/app/dashboards#/view/ce1179f0-bd18-11ed-bee3-278b0da2c55e?_g=(filters:!(),refreshInterval:(pause:!f,value:5000),time:(from:now-1h,to:now)))

There you are !
You should see your issue created earlier.
