> Repeat this operation as many times as you wish

> You should select at least the namespace where this repository has been created to retrieve the initial issue posted


Now that the GitHub App has been created and installed, it can be used to query the API and reach the authorized repository issues.
A service-to-service application will authenticate using the app as follow:

1. Generate a JWT using the `<app_id>` and the `<private_key>`

2. Query the API using the JWT as a token to list installations

3. Claim an access token for a given installation

4. Use the access token to query the business operations
